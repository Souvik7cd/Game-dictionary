# Game-dictionary
Here I have two dictionaries, both almost the same. The dictionaries does not contain any alphanumeric, numeric, abbreviations or acronyms and hyphenated words, serving a real worthy collection of words for games.

# 1. ospd.txt:
  The original file with 79339 words that can be used for any kind of word games.
  
# 2. dict.txt:
  The edited file with 79245 words. Words of length 2 or less are deleted. This may serve a special purpose for a game that I have in mind.
